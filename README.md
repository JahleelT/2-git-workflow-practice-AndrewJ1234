This article was interesting because it discussed a new ChatGPT, OpenAI o1, that could significantly impact the world, both positively and negatively. It is cool to see that we have yet again made another remarkable advancement in AI. This development is another major step forward: an AI that can not only respond but also take time to think through problems, a major advancement from the previous ChatGPT versions. Recent upgrades to the newest model of ChatGPT show a positive correlation similar to the explosive growth of popularity the previous model enjoyed. Now, with this new version in development, we may witness another wave of change. On one hand, it could continue to benefit businesses by cutting costs and improve profits; on the other hand, it might lead to more people losing their jobs, being replaced by AI.
